Oracle Reporting & Analytics (R&A) — What It Really Is

Oracle Reporting & Analytics (R&A) is a separate, cloud-hosted reporting platform that sits outside the core Simphony POS transaction engine.

Think of it as:

Read-optimized analytics layer fed by Simphony transactional data

It is not part of the EMC.
It has its own users, roles, permissions, and security model.

Key implications:

R&A is near-real-time, not always real-time

If R&A is down, POS still runs

If POS is down, R&A becomes stale but still accessible

User & Security Model (This Is Where People Get Burned)
❗ R&A DOES NOT USE SIMPHONY EMPLOYEES

This is critical.

POS employees ≠ R&A users

R&A users are created and managed separately

There is no automatic inheritance from EMC roles

R&A User Types

Individual named users

Group-based assignments (recommended for scale)

Each user is assigned:

Data Scope

Functional Permissions

Report Access

Data Scope Hierarchy (Very Important)

R&A respects the Simphony enterprise hierarchy, but only for filtering, not security inheritance.

Typical hierarchy:

Enterprise
 └─ Property
     └─ Revenue Center (RVC)


You explicitly define:

Which properties

Which RVCs

Which regions (if enabled)

A user can:

See multiple properties

Be restricted to a single RVC

Be cross-property but read-only

Permission Model (Actual Structure)
1️⃣ Functional Permissions (What they can do)

Examples:

View dashboards

Run standard reports

Export data (CSV / Excel)

Schedule reports

Create custom dashboards (advanced users)

Administer users (very limited group)

These are orthogonal to data scope.

2️⃣ Data Access Permissions (What data they see)

Controlled by:

Property access

RVC access

Business date ranges

Sometimes tender visibility (depending on report)

This prevents:

Franchisees seeing corporate data

Managers seeing other locations

Vendors seeing sensitive metrics

3️⃣ Report-Level Permissions (What reports they see)

Reports are grouped by folders:

Sales

Labor

Financial

Operations

Enterprise summaries

Users can be allowed:

Folder access

Individual report access

Dashboard-only access (no raw reports)

Standard Report Categories
Sales & Revenue

Net / Gross sales

Category & item sales

Discounts & voids

Check averages

Order type mix

Labor

Hours worked

Labor % of sales

Overtime

Clock-in/out compliance

Cash & Financial

Cash over/short

Tender mix

Paid ins/outs

Refund totals

Operations

Open checks

Voids by employee

Discounts by employee

Service charge activity

Enterprise / Multi-Property

Roll-ups

Comparisons

Trend analysis

Dashboards vs Reports (Important Distinction)
Reports

Static

Parameter-driven

Exportable

Often operational or audit-focused

Dashboards

Visual

Aggregated

Often executive-focused

Not always exportable at detail level

Good operators limit dashboard creation to avoid metric chaos.

Scheduling & Distribution

R&A supports:

Scheduled report delivery

Email distribution

Multiple formats (PDF, XLS, CSV)

Time-based automation (daily close, weekly summaries)

Best practice:

Let managers consume dashboards

Let finance consume scheduled exports

Avoid letting everyone self-export (data leakage risk)
