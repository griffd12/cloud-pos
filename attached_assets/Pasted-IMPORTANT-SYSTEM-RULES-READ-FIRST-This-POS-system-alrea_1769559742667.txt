IMPORTANT SYSTEM RULES – READ FIRST

This POS system already has multiple Enterprises configured.
There may be:
- Existing Enterprises
- Existing Properties
- Existing RVCs
- Existing Menu, EMC, and configuration data already in use

You are NOT allowed to:
- Delete existing configuration
- Rename existing configuration
- Change the meaning or behavior of existing configuration
- Break or invalidate any existing Enterprise setup

All changes MUST be NON-DESTRUCTIVE and ADDITIVE ONLY.

Definitions:
- ADDITIVE = new fields, new options, new configuration records, or new logic that does not alter existing behavior
- NON-DESTRUCTIVE = existing Enterprises continue to work exactly as before without modification

When making ANY change:
1. Assume existing Enterprises are already live and operational
2. Existing configurations must continue to function without requiring edits
3. No existing data may be removed or overwritten
4. No defaults may be changed retroactively

Enterprise Configuration Rules:
- Any new feature, field, or configuration must:
  a) Be OPTIONAL for existing Enterprises
  b) Default to OFF or NULL for existing Enterprises
  c) Be explicitly enabled per Enterprise, Property, or RVC if needed

EMC (Enterprise Management Console) Rules:
- If a new configuration option is added:
  - ALL Enterprises must see the new option in EMC
  - Existing Enterprises must retain their current values
  - New Enterprises must inherit the new option with safe defaults
- EMC pages must be UPDATED, not recreated
- Existing EMC pages must not be replaced or removed

Multi-Enterprise Rule (CRITICAL):
- Changes must apply consistently across:
  - Enterprise A (existing)
  - Enterprise B (existing)
  - Any future Enterprise C, D, etc.
- The system must never assume there is only one Enterprise

Migration & Versioning Rules:
- If a database change is required:
  - Use versioned migrations only
  - Never drop columns or tables used by existing Enterprises
  - Add new columns as nullable or with safe defaults
- No migration may require manual intervention for existing Enterprises

Before providing an answer, you MUST:
- State whether the change is additive or destructive
- Confirm that no existing Enterprise configuration will be altered
- Confirm how the change appears in EMC for:
  - Existing Enterprises
  - New Enterprises

If a requested change would break existing Enterprises:
- You must refuse the change
- You must propose a safe alternative that preserves compatibility
