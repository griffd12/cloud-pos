ORACLE SIMPHONY–STYLE DEVICE CONFIGURATION

Workstations, Printers, KDS, and Order Routing

1. DEVICE MODEL OVERVIEW (How Simphony Thinks)

Simphony separates physical devices, logical roles, and routing rules.

You must do the same.

Core device layers

Workstations – where orders are entered

Printers – where output is printed

KDS Devices – where orders are displayed

Order Devices – logical routing containers

Print Classes – logical grouping for menu routing

❗ Key rule:
Menu items do NOT point directly to printers.
They point to Print Classes, which resolve to Order Devices, which contain printers/KDS.

2. WORKSTATION CONFIGURATION (FOH TERMINALS)
Purpose

Defines how a POS terminal behaves, what it can do, and what it controls.

Required Workstation Attributes (AI MUST CREATE)
Identity

Workstation ID (unique)

Name (e.g., Front Counter 1)

Property ID

RVC ID

Device Type:

POS Terminal

Self-Service Kiosk

Manager Station

Functional Behavior

Default Order Type (Dine In / Take Out / etc.)

Fast Transaction Enabled (Yes/No)

Require Begin Check (Yes/No)

Allow Pickup Check (Yes/No)

Allow Reopen Closed Checks (Yes/No)

Allow Offline Operation (Yes/No)

Employee Interaction

Allowed Roles (Cashier, Server, Manager, etc.)

Manager Approval Device (Yes/No)

Clock-In Allowed (Yes/No)

Routing & Printing

Default Receipt Printer

Backup Receipt Printer

Default Order Device (optional)

Default KDS Expo (optional)

Network / System

IP Address or Hostname

Online / Offline Status

Last Seen Timestamp

3. PRINTER CONFIGURATION (CRITICAL)
Printer Types in Simphony

Receipt Printers (guest checks)

Order Printers (kitchen/bar/prep)

Report Printers (manager reports – optional)

Required Printer Attributes
Identity

Printer ID

Name (e.g., Kitchen Printer – Hot Line)

Property ID

Printer Type:

Receipt

Kitchen

Bar

Prep

Report

Connection

Connection Type:

Network (IP)

USB

Serial (legacy)

IP Address / Port (for network printers)

Driver / Protocol:

ESC/POS

StarPRNT

Epson TM

Character Width (42 / 48 / 56)

Behavior

Auto Cut (Yes/No)

Print Logo (Yes/No)

Print Order Header/Footer

Print Voids / Cancellations (Yes/No)

Print Reprints (Yes/No)

Failover

Backup Printer ID

Retry Attempts

Failure Handling Mode:

Fail silently

Alert cashier

Reroute to backup

4. KDS DEVICE CONFIGURATION
Purpose

Displays live orders to production stations.

Required KDS Attributes
Identity

KDS Device ID

Name (e.g., Hot Line KDS 1)

Property ID

Station Type:

Hot

Cold

Prep

Expo

Display Rules

Show Draft (Unsent) Items (Yes/No)

Show Sent Items Only (Yes/No)

Group by Order / Item / Course

Show Timers (Yes/No)

Auto-Sort by Priority / Time

Interaction

Allow Bump

Allow Recall

Allow Void Display

Expo Mode (Yes/No)

Network

WebSocket Channel / Station Subscription

Last Seen Timestamp

5. ORDER DEVICES (THE MOST MISSED CONCEPT)
What an Order Device Is (Simphony Concept)

An Order Device is a logical routing container that can contain:

One or more printers

One or more KDS devices

Examples

Hot Line

Cold Prep

Bar

Expo

Required Order Device Attributes
Identity

Order Device ID

Name

Property ID

Linked Devices

Printer IDs (0..N)

KDS Device IDs (0..N)

Behavior

Send On:

Send Button

Dynamic (as rung)

Send Voids (Yes/No)

Send Reprints (Yes/No)

6. PRINT CLASSES (MENU ROUTING LOGIC)
Purpose

Decouples menu items from physical devices.

Required Print Class Attributes

Print Class ID

Code (stable identifier)

Name (e.g., HOT_FOOD)

Scope (Enterprise / Property / RVC)

Active Flag

Routing

Print Class → Order Device (per Property / RVC)

Menu Item Link

Menu Item → Print Class

🔑 This allows:

Same menu item to route differently per property

No menu edits when printers change

7. COMPLETE ROUTING FLOW (EXACTLY LIKE SIMPHONY)
Menu Item
   ↓
Print Class
   ↓ (resolved per Property/RVC)
Order Device
   ↓
Printer(s) + KDS Device(s)

8. REQUIRED DATA AI MUST GENERATE

When configuring devices, AI must generate:

For Each Workstation

Behavioral flags

Default routing

Role restrictions

Network identity

For Each Printer

Connection details

Type and behavior flags

Backup routing

For Each KDS

Station type

Display rules

Interaction permissions

For Each Order Device

Linked printers

Linked KDS screens

Send behavior

For Each Print Class

Scope-aware routing rules

9. WHY THIS MATTERS (REALITY CHECK)

If AI:

Routes menu items directly to printers ❌

Doesn’t support Order Devices ❌

Doesn’t support Print Classes ❌

Doesn’t model Workstation behavior ❌

Then you do not have a Simphony-class POS, and it will break the moment:

You add a second kitchen

You add Expo

A printer dies

A property routes items differently
